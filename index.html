    <h1>Veku!</h1>
    <h2>Welcome!</h2>

    <p>
      Hey! You over there! Yes, I’m talking to you. I’m <strong>Čeluria /tʃe.lu.ʒja/</strong>, 
      a constructed language created by none other than Ruixing Liu [ʑweʵ eɪn˥ ljou˥] 
      (Yeah I know it’s hard to pronounce as hell if you happen coming from a place like me 
      where speech doesn't distinguish between tones). I’m super young, which makes me 
      super cool, and if you’re a multilingual enthusiast like my creator, you’ll 
      probably notice that I blend features from Chinese, English, and Spanish. 
      He wanted me to have the readability of Spanish, the flexible tense system of 
      Chinese, and the versatility of English.
    </p>

    <p>
      At first, I was just supposed to be some dorm-room secret code for him and his 
      friends—something no one else could understand. But somehow, I turned into this 
      actual “thing” you could legitimately call a language. Let me remind you, though, 
      I’m still a baby in the language world, so I obviously don’t know everything. 
      My creator gets that too, which is why he’s constantly expanding my vocabulary 
      and tweaking my rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you happen to spot a loophole (oops), head over to the contact page to let him 
      know! (Although, if you’re one of his unlucky friends coerced into checking out 
      this page, chances are you don’t need the contact page—you’ve already heard from 
      him in person.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Want to explore me? Start with my sound structure and writing system, then move on 
      to the grammar section and example sentences. To be honest, even the word <em>welcome</em> 
      was something my creator came up with on the spot while building this website. 
      That’s why I keep saying—I’m still very young and have a long way to go. But what 
      matters is that he’s doing his best to create me in a consistent and rule-based 
      way, and for now, that’s enough.
    </p>

    <p>
      Anyway, have fun exploring me! And who knows? Maybe you’ll discover something cool.
